1. Taking inspiration from a website by the Straits Times published recently about a very similar topic as this one, I think staying on a single

    down instead of constantly opening new pages would definitely be nicer.  23/10/2021
    a) An issue I faced previously is finding a way to put two/multiple (canvas) graphs in a single page. Making them appear properly and on demand never worked properly.
