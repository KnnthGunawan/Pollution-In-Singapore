        <div>
            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="1">Not quite. The last time Singapore was at 185 million tonnes was in 2010.</p>
            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="2">Close, but Singapore was at 127 million tonnes in 2005.</p>
            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="info">That's more than 30 million elephants, or 7 million Statue of Liberties, or 33 thousand Marina Bay Sands, or...</p>
            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="info_p2">You get the idea. It's a lot.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Over the last 50 years, C02 emissions from fossil-fuels of Singapore grew substainially from 21 to 211 million tonnes. That's a lot of emissions, but where does it come from?</p>

            <p>Singapore contributes around 0.1 per cent of global emissions. Most of Singapore's emissions are produced in the industry sector, followed by the power sector. (Click on the pie chart to see how much!)</p>
            <p>Singapore's strategic position along the East-West trade routes has made the country a natural location for oil storage and refining facilities.</p>
            <p>Using the nation's position as a key regional port, the refining and petrochemical plants help create good business relationships with countries in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, South Asia and Australasia</p>

        <h2>What is a Carbon Footprint?</h2>
        <p>A Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.</p>
        <p>The term was popularized by a $250 million advertising campaign by the oil and gas company BP in an attempt to move public attention away from restricitng fossil fuel companies and onto individual reponsibility for solving climate change. A decade and a half later, the term "carbon footprint" can be found everywhere.</p>
        <p>In 2004 the company unveiled its "carbon footprint calculator" so anyone could assess how their normal daily life is largely responsible for heating the globe. Even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">carbon calculator</a>. This illusive, but successful campaign has manipulated our thinking about one of the greatest environmental threats of our time.</p>
        <p>There is no shame in trying to reduce your carbon footprint. However, we must not ignore the effects that oil and gas companies have on the environment. Switching off an unused light is simply not enough to counter BP's 1.99 million barrels of oil produced per day (2020).</p>
        <p>However, we much remember that our personal choices DO have an impact on the environment, and if we work together, we can help lower our country's environmental impact.</p>
