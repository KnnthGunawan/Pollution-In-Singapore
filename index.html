        <p>Singapore is a small country, but it still holds a substantially high CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Per Capita:

            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="info" style="font-size: 16px;">That's right! Singapore produced <span style="color: #FF4742; font-weight: bold;"> 211,000,000</span> tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuels in 2020! That's about 30 million elephants, or 7 million Statue of Liberties, or 33 thousand Marina Bay Sands, or...</p>

            <h3 id="padding">Singapore's Emissions Profile (2018)</h3>
            <div id="piechart" class="piechart"></div>
            <div id="padding">
                <p>As of 2020, Singapore contributes 0.13% of global emissions. Although this is quite small, the Singapore Government is still taking steps to reduce carbon emissions. A large percentage of its emissions is from the industry and power sector (Click the pie chart to see how much!). </p>
                <p>One reason for this is because of Singapore's location along prominent East-West trade routes.</p>
                <p>Progress requires sacrifice. If we want a greener future, we will need to change the way Singapore, and any other country, operates. One obvious step would be to lower the emissions from the country's industry sector. However, not everyone has the power to do this, and Singapore's economy relies heavily on these facilities.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">A more realistic solution would be to do what we can, then campaign for change in the larger sectors. In order to achieve this, we need to learn one of the most widely-used terms when combatting carbon emissions: <span style="color: #FF4742; font-weight: bold;">Carbon Footprint</span>.</p>

            <h2>What is a Carbon Footprint?</h2>
            <img src="Images/noun-footprint-3918515-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="left">A Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.</p>
            <img src="Images/noun-advertisement-4159945-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="right">The term was popularized by a $250 million advertising campaign by the oil and gas company BP in an attempt to move public attention away from restricting fossil fuel companies and onto individual responsibility for solving climate change. Nowadays, the term can be found everywhere.</p>
            <img src="Images/noun-carbon-dioxide-3933168-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="left">In 2004 BP created a "carbon footprint calculator", which you could use to calculate how your daily life is largely responsible for climate change. These calculators are now used by several organizations. Even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/">one</a>. This campaign has misguided millions into thinking that climate change is a personal problem, when in reality companies, such as BP, are largely responsible for the problem.</p>
            <img src="Images/noun-oil-drum-1681808-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="right">There is no shame in trying to reduce your carbon footprint. However, we must not ignore the effects that oil and gas companies have on the environment. Switching off an unused light is simply not enough to counter BP's 1.99 million barrels of oil produced per day (2020).</p>
            <img src="Images/noun-environment-2693412-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="left">However, we must remember that our personal choices DO have an impact on the environment, and if we work together, we can help lower our country's environmental impact.</p>
            <h3>Find Out How</h3>
            <img src="Images/noun-arrow-1787131-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="arrow">
        </div>
        <div class="transition_2">
            <h6>While it may seem hard to lower this number as an individual, if we all changed the way we live together, we can greatly lower our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<br><br>Let us start with transport...</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="Page_5">
            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <img src="Images/noun-bicycle-1311416-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p>Taking public transport is one of the most efficient ways to lower your carbon footprint. If you can, try taking public transportation such as buses or the MRT. If your destination is close enough, consider walking or riding a bike. These choices lower your emissions, while also keeping you active.</p>
            <h6>Fact: A car carrying only the driver uses 9 times the energy used by a bus, and 12 times that used by a train on a per passenger-kilometer travelled basis!</h6>
            <hr>
            <h3>Recycling</h3>
            <img src="Images/noun-recycle-4454668-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p>One of the most obvious ways to help is by recycling. Recycling reduces the need for extracting, refining and processing raw materials, which all create substantial air and water pollution. Recycling also saves energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The more you recycle, the less amount of rubbish is sent to be incinerated.</p>
            <h6>Fact: Out of the 7.23 million tonnes of solid waste generated in 2019 in Singapore, more than 40% of it was incinerated!</h6>
            <hr>
            <h3>Eating Less Meat</h3>
            <img src="Images/noun-meat-113747-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p>Research has shown that reducing meat intake and swapping meat for fruits and vegetables is one of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint. Emissions from livestock, like beef and dairy cattle, represent 14.5% of the globe's human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            <h6>Fact: Researchers have also found that cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint by up to 73%!</h6>            
            <hr>
            <h4 style="padding: 1rem 0;">These examples can help you decrease your overall emissions.</h4>
