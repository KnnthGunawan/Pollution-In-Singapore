            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="2">Close, but Singapore was at 127 million tonnes in 2005.</p>
            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="info" style="font-size: 16px;">That's right! Singapore produced <span style="color: #FF4742; font-weight: bold;"> 211,000,000</span> tonnes of C02 from fossil fuels in 2020! That's about 30 million elephants, or 7 million Statue of Liberties, or 33 thousand Marina Bay Sands, or...</p>
            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="info_p2">You get the idea. <br> It's a lot.</p>
            <p class="fade-in" style="display: none;" id="info_p3" style="color: #FF4742; font-weight: bold;">Over the last 50 years, C02 emissions from fossil-fuels of Singapore grew substainially from 21 to 211 million tonnes.</p>

            <div id="padding">
                <p>Singapore contributes only 0.1% of global emissions. Although this is quite small, the Singaporean Government is still taking steps to reduce its carbon emissions. A large percentage of its emissions is from the industry and power sector (Click the pie chart to see how much). </p>
                <p>This is because  of Singapore's strategic position along the East-West trade routes, which has made the country a natural location for oil storage and refining facilities.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">Using the nation's position as a key regional port, the refining and petrochemical plants help create good business relationships with countries in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, South Asia and Australasia.</p>

            <h2>What is a Carbon Footprint?</h2>
            <img src="Images/noun-footprint-3918515-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="left">A Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.</p>
            <img src="Images/noun-advertisement-4159945-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="right">The term was popularized by a $250 million advertising campaign by the oil and gas company BP in an attempt to move public attention away from restricitng fossil fuel companies and onto individual reponsibility for solving climate change. A decade and a half later, the term "carbon footprint" can be found everywhere.</p>
            <img src="Images/noun-carbon-dioxide-3933168-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="left">In 2004 the company unveiled its "carbon footprint calculator" so anyone could assess how their normal daily life is largely responsible for heating the globe. Even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/">carbon calculator</a>. This illusive, but successful campaign has manipulated our thinking about one of the greatest environmental threats of our time.</p>
            <img src="Images/noun-oil-drum-1681808-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="right">There is no shame in trying to reduce your carbon footprint. However, we must not ignore the effects that oil and gas companies have on the environment. Switching off an unused light is simply not enough to counter BP's 1.99 million barrels of oil produced per day (2020).</p>
            <img src="Images/noun-environment-2693412-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p class="left">However, we must remember that our personal choices DO have an impact on the environment, and if we work together, we can help lower our country's environmental impact.</p>

        <div class="transition_2">
            <h6>While it may seem hard to lower this number as an individual, if we all changed the way we live together, we can greatly lower our C02 emissions.<br><br>Letâ€™s start with transport...</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="Page_5">
            <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Transportation</h3>
            <img src="Images/noun-bicycle-1311416-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p>Taking public transport is one of the most efficient ways to lower your carbon footprint. If you can, try taking public transportation such as buses or the MRT. If your destination is close enough, consider walking or riding a bike. These choices lower your emissions, while also keeping you active.</p>
            <h6>Fact: A car carrying only the driver uses 9 times the energy used by a bus, and 12 times that used by a train on a per passenger-kilometre travelled basis!</h6>

            <h3>Recycling</h3>
            <img src="Images/noun-recycle-4454668-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p>One of the most obvious ways to help is by recycling. Recycling reduces the need for extracting, refining and processing raw materials, which all create substantial air and water pollution. Recycling also saves energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The more you recycle, the less amount of rubbish is sent to be incinerated.</p>
            <h6>Fact: Out of the 7.23 million tonnes of solid waste generated in 2019 in Singapore, more than 40% of it was incinerated!</h6>

            <h3>Eating Less Meat</h3>
            <img src="Images/noun-meat-113747-modified.png" alt="Icon" id="icon">
            <p>Research has shown that reducing meat intake and swapping meat for fruits and vegetables is one of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint. Emissions from livestock, like beef and dairy cattle, represent 14.5% of the globe's human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            <h6 style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Fact: Researchers have also found that cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint by up to 73%!</h6>
