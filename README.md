# Hello!

This is a short, interactive website I made that discusses the issue of pollution in Singapore. 
Using Javascript I visualized emission data, and also added a simple carbon footprint calculator at the end.
The entire website was built from scratch using html and css, and all sources are cited in the "sources.txt" file.

With that said, please have a read!

# Enjoy!
