    <h2>What is a <a onclick="toggleText()" href="#">Carbon Footprint</a> ?</h2>
    <p id='pollution-text' style='display: none'>A Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.</p>
    
    <!--History of Carbon Footprint-->
    <div class="div_right" style="display: none;" id="1">
        <p>The term was popularized by a $250 million advertising campaign by the oil and gas company BP in an attempt to move public attention away from restricitng fossil fuel companies and onto individual reponsibility for solving climate change.</p>
        <p>A decade and a half later, the term "carbon footprint" can be found everywhere. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div_left" style="display: none;" id="2">
        <p>In 2004 the company unveiled its "carbon footprint calculator" so anyone could arywhere. Even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/" style="text-decoration: underline;">carbon calculator</a>.</p>
        <p>This illusive, but successful campaign has manipulated our thinking about one of the greatest environmental threats of our time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div_right" style="display: none;" id="3">
        <p>There is no shame in trying to reduce your carbon footprint. However, we must not ignore the effects that oil and gas companies have on the environment. Switching off an unused light is simply not enough to counter BP's 1.99 million barrels of oil produced per day (2020).</p>
